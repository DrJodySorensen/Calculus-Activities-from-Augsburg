## Partial Derivatives using Wind Chill

This activity, which introduces partial derivatives using the context of wind chill (based on temperature and wind speed) is one of my favorites. I was so happy to find both the chart and the associated formula used by meteorologists.  This is very relatable content for our Minnesota students.  

In this activity students estimate partial derivatives with respect to both variables.  Next they follow an example to determine partial derivatives using the equation.  The activity also introduces partial derivative notation.
