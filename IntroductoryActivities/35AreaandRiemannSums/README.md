## Area and Accumulation

On day 35 we introduce the idea of approximating the area under a curve using Riemann sums.  

The application is simple, finding the area of a window.  

The point of the day is to introduce Riemann sums and to point out that it is an approach which can be used to approximate area to a desired accuracy (if you're willing to do the work).
