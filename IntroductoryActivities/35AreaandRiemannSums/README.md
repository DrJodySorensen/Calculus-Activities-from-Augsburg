## Area and Accumulation

On day 35 we introduce the idea of approximating the area under a curve using Riemann sums.  

The application is simple, finding the area of a window.  The activity uses a Desmos file to do the Riemann sum calculation.  
It also introduces sigma notation using some simple examples.  

The point of the day is to introduce Riemann sums and to point out that it is an approach which can be used to approximate area to a desired accuracy (if you're willing to do the work).
