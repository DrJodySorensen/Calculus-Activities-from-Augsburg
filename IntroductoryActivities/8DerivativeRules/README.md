## Derivative Rules AKA Algebra of Derivatives

Day 8 introduces some basic derivative rules: derivative of a sum, derivative of a constant multiple, and derivative of a constant.  

These ideas are introduced in a few different ways: with practical examples (fishing yields and manufacturing costs), and also graphically.  Ideas will also be presented algebraically in the lecture and homework.
