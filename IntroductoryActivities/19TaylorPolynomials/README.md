## Intro to Taylor Polynomials

On Day 19 we introduce Taylor Polynomials.  This activity starts with some practice with factorials, then uses Desmos to let students experiment with different constants in such polynomials, and to get a sense of what "best fit at a point" looks like.  

In our experience, it takes multiple exposures for students to get used to the idea of approximating a function by a polynomial, and so we prefer to touch on this concept early on.  

This activity contains a Desmos link, which I believe should be open to all.
