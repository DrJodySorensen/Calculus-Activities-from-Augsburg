## Integration by Substitution

The topic for today is integration by substitution.  There's no application in this activity, just several pretty straightfoward examples.  

The activity starts with some chain rule practice.  Then does some intuitive examples like $\int 3x^2\cos(x^3) dx$.  The second page walks through $u$-substitution.  The mechanics of $u$-substitution need to be reinforced through lecture and practice.
