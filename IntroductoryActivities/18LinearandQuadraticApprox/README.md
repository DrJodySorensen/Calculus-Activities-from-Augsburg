## Linear and Quadratic Approximation

Day 18's activity uses an example of the fine for speeding to develop the idea of a quadratic approximation to a function at a point.  

It starts with a linear approximation, which should be familiar but is always a good refresher.  Then it builds a quadratic approximation using the second derivative.  

Students often need some help seeing that the quadratic coefficient needs to be divided by two, so we usually work through some details as a group.  

Note: when renovating our calculus courses, we moved some topics between Calculus 1 and 2.  Limits are treated more seriously in Calc 2.  This makes room for a couple of days on Taylor polynomials in Calc 1.  We also added a day on partial derivatives to Calc 1 (Day 20), at the request of our partner disciplines.
