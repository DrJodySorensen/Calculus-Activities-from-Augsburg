## First Day of Optimization

This is one of the first exploratory activities we developed as part of this work.  

It uses an Economics example with maximizing revenue.  It's a clear idea of maximization that's easy to understand and visualize. It's nice that the derivative involves both the product rule and chain rule as well.  

The activity also nudges students towards the idea of the First Derivative Test.
