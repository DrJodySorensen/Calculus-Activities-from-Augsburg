## The Definite Integral

This is a version of an activity I've been using in Calculus I for ages.  It uses the simple idea that velocity times length of time gives distance traveled to build up to the FTC.  

The scenario has been simplified to fit in a shorter period of time, but this activity still takes more than the allotted 20 minutes.  I find it valuable to refer back to over the next several days of class and thus well worth doing.
