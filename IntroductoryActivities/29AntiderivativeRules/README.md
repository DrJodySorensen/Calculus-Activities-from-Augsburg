## Antiderivative Rules

This day is a chance for students to develop and understand basic antiderivatives: powers and polynomials, exponentials, and trig functions.  

The activity is an applied example using velocity and position - we avoid having physics as the sole source of applied content in our course, but position - velocity - acceleration is a relatable context for understanding derivatives and antiderivatives.
