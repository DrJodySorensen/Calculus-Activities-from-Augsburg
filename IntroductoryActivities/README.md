## Introductory Activities

These are the daily introductory activities for our first semester calculus class.  At Augsburg we have only one set of calculus courses - no business calc or honors calc or engineering calc.  We serve a broad audience, and we hope these activities reflect a wide range of interesting applications.  

Each section includes a .pdf file of the activity, and a .zip file containing the LaTeX file (.tex) as well as any relevant images. 

Please contace me with questions, comments, and suggestions!
