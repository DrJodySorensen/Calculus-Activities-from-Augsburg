## Parametric and Implicit Derivatives

After learning about parametric and implicit equations on Day 24, we discuss derivatives of these curves on Day 25. 

The activity starts with the parametric equations of a cycloid, the path of a point on a wheel.  The students find dx/dt, dy/dt, and then dy/dx and compare the slope at a point with the graph.  

The activity then walks through implicit differentiation.  Many students need some help working through this.  For most activities the students work through on their own, with the instructor circulating and answering students as needed.  But occasionally students as a group need to see an example before returning to the activity.
