##Instantaneous Rate of Change

This activity introduces instantaneous rate of change as average rate of change over a smaller and smaller interval.  In the lecture we use limits informally.  
As always, we encourage students to use Desmos to do calculations and graphing.  
The only application here is a return to the Love example from Day 2.  But certainly the lecture and practice problems emphasize units and interpretation as well.
