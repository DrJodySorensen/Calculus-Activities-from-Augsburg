## Derivative as a Function

This activity uses two examples to explore the idea of looking at the derivative as a function - finding the derivative at every point creates a new function.  

The two examples are caffeine level in the bloodstream (exponential decay), and the speed of an airplane.  Both are graphical rather than explicit equations, which is partially done to make calculations quicker.
