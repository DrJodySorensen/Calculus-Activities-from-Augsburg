## Systems of Differential Equations

Day 3 is a little different.  Instead of a written group activity, we do an active simulation of the S-I-R (Susceptible - Infected - Recovered) disease model.  

We start by having one random student infected and all other susceptible.  We generate random pairs using random.org .  Being paired with an infected person makes you infected.  Once infected you stay infected for 5 rounds.  We count and track the different populations until everyone is Recovered, collecting the data in a spreadsheet.  

We then spend time looking at the data numerically and graphically, then creating and discussing the equations and so on.
