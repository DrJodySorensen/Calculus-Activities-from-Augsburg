## Local Linearity

This activity uses a straightforward example from Economics to introduce the idea of local linearity and using the tangent line to estimate function values. It enforces the idea of using the tangent line without yet formalizing it as an equation.

It also explores the difference between average and marginal cost, i.e. between average and instantaneous rate of change.
