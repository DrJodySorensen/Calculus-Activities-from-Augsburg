## Integration by Parts

Today is a first look at integration by parts.  This is the last topic before Exam 3.  

The activity of course starts with some product rule practice.  It then walks through the development of the formula and a few examples.  It includes a volume problem as a final example.  

This is a longer activity - I typically work through some of the problems as examples in the lecture part of class.
