## Graphs and Derivatives (Increasing, Decreasing, Concavity, Inflection Points)

On Day 14 we make more connections between derivatives and shapes of graphs: increasing and decreasing, and also the connection between concavity and second derivatives.  

The activity discusses a simple quadratic example, and also makes connections with the S-I-R model from earlier in the course.
