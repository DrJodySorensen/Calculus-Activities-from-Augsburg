## Introduction to Differential Equations

We did a quick glimpse of differential equations on Day 3, but this is the first real day on the topic.  Day 26 focus on recongnizing and verifying solutions to DEs, and also finding particular solutions when given the general solution.  This day is also designed to start introducing students to the precise vocabulary used with differential equations.   

The applied example here is a saturation model of population growth - the same type of equation as Newton's Law of Cooling.  Students are asked to demonstrate that certain functions are and are not solutions.  We find that this is one of the hardest concepts for students to absorb when it comes to DEs.
