This activity is used on the first day of Calculus 1.  We do very little intro and have students jump right in to working on this activity.  
We encourage them to work together in small groups of three or four.  All activities are designed to take about 20 minutes, although on the first day things take a little longer.  
The goals of this activity are numerous: get students used to the structure of the course.  Get students used to working in groups.  Get students to get to know their classmates.  Oh and also to begin looking at rates of change in a context that might be of interest to them.  
This activity is especially valuable for its focus on units, and on making predicitions based on existing data.
