## Last Day - Chain Rule again 

We use this as a review day for the upcoming final exam.  The activity makes use of the chain rule in a realistic context.  

The activity, of interest to our Minnesota students, is about the effectiveness of different compounds in melting ice on the roads.  We love that this is a real world example, and that the units are more interesting than position depending on time.  

This is definitely a longer activity, so plan accordingly.
