## Euler's Method

On this day we cover both Euler's Method and slope fields.  

The activity uses a logistic model of language learning as the applied example.  Students work through a couple of steps of Euler's method by hand, and connecting the steps with the slope field.  

The lecture portion is used to show how to organize the steps of Euler's method into a table.
