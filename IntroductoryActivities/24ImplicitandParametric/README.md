## Intro to Parametric and Implicit Equations

In addition to partial derivatives, we spend a couple of days in Calculus 1 with implicit and parametric equations.  This is the first day which introduces these types of equations, with help from Desmos.  Finding and interpreting derivatives of these curves is done on Day 25.  

The parametric equations in this activity model the motion of a moon orbiting a planet.
