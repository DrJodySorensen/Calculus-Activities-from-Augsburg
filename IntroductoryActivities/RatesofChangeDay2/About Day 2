In this activity we took an idea from Chemistry about attraction between molecules, and reimagined it in terms of a relationship.  

This activity works towards the idea of instantaneous rate of change, while also work with a concrete, relatdable example with interesting units and interpretations.  

As a reminder, we encourage students to use Desmos when doing calculations and graphing.  It's free, accessible, and creates much better graphs than a graphing calculator.
