## Product and Quotient Rules

After Exam 1 we start with the product and quotient rules for derivatives.  

This activity focuses on the product rules.  It has three parts: 
- a practical example comparing rates of change
- an algebraic example showing $f'(x)\cdot g'(x)$ doesn't work
- a geometric explanation of the product rule
