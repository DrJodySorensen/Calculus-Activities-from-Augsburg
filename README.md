# Calculus-Activities-from-Augsburg

A team at Augsburg University started work on the NSF SUMMIT-P grant in 2018.  We renovated our two calculus courses, with our goal being to make the courses more active and more applied. Our primary team consisted of three mathematicians, plus a chemist and an economist.  
We committed to a structure where every class started with a group activity, usually applied, that introduced the big new idea for that day.  
We ended up calling our structure 20-20-20: 20 minutes of introductory activity, 20 minutes of "just barely enough" lecture, and 20 minutes of student problem solving in pairs at the whiteboard.  
We are sharing the introductory activities here, in both .pdf and .tex formats.  The LaTeX files are in the .zip, with any relevant images included.  

I want to credit my colleagues who shared in creating this work: Dr. Pavel Bėlìk, Dr. Suzanne Dorée, Dr. Stella Hofrenning (Economics), and Dr. Joan Kunz (Chemistry), along with mathematics colleagues Dr. Matthew Haines and Dr. John Zobitz.  All at Augsburg University.
