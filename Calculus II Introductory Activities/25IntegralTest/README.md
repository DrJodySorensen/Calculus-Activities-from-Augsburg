## The Integral Test

Today we go back to infinite series and introduce the Integral Test and p-series.  

The activity walks through an example connecting an improper integral with an infinite series.  There's no applied example today, the work is to connect and remember ideas of improper integral and infinite series.  

Students really struggle with part (h) and always need a nudge or two.  But it's valuable in emphasizing the idea that the series and the integral do not have the same numerical value.  

Lecture is spent formalizing the integral test and doing a couple of examples, leading to p-series.
