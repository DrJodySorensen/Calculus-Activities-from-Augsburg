## Systems of Differential Equations

This is a fun day on simple systems of differential equations.  Students enjoy it, and it allows them to consider DE's in a different way.  

The applied example is a predator prey systems like bats and mosquitos.  Students explore the equations, consider equilibrium solutions, and, with some help, create a 2D phase portrait.
