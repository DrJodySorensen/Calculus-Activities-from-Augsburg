## Taylor Series

This straightforward activity walks students through a couple of examples of creating and checking Taylor Series.  

With Desmos it's easy and fun to create lovely graphs of the original function and several Taylor polynomials of varying degree.  I want students to appreciate the beauty of Taylor series, and visually understand the idea of interval of convergence.
