## Integration by Parts

Today's activity leads students through an integration by parts example.  It starts with some Product Rule practice, then looks at $\int x \cos(x) \ dx$.  We ask students to check the answer $x \sin(x)$ and discover what needs to be added to get the correct derivative.  

In class we give the integration by parts formula (which the students have derived most of the way), and do oh so many examples.
