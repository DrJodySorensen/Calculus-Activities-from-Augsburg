## Infinite Series

This activity introduces infinite series more generally.  There are a lot of pieces: looking at finite sums and discerning a pattern, comparing a series and an integral, and recognizing a series as being telescoping.  The main emphasis is growing familiarity with the idea of a convergent infinite sum.  

With all of that there is no applied context for this day.
