## Volume by Cross Sections

Today's example is finding the volume of a cone using integration.  

In my experience many students are not used to thinking about geometry, especially volume and visualizing in 3D.  This activity walks them through finding the volume of a cone through integrating (adding up) horizontal cross sections.  I typically interrupt their work at a few points to help them visualize and remember some geometry.  

Class time is spent on volumes of solids of revolution, both disks and washers.
