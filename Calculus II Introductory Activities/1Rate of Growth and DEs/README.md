Day 1, Review, Rate of Growth, and Solutions to Differential Equations

This activity is the first thing students do on the first day of Calculus II - before discussing the syllabus or grading or Calculus I.  

It is designed to get their wheels turning while not scaring them about what they do and do not remember from Calculus I.  

It also introduces a few important classes of differential equations: exponential, logistic, and a saturation model (like in Newton's Law of Heating or Cooling).
