## Back to Differential Equations

Today we go back to differential equations.  We consider equilibrium solutions, and get a formula for the solution to $\frac{dy}[dx} = Ay+B$. 

The applied example is modeling the number of fish in a hatchery.  Students consider equilibrium solutions and stability before explicitly solving the DE.
