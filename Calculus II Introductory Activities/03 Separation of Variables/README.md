Day 3 Separation of Variables

Today's activity walks through the steps of separation of variables.  Note that this process uses indefinite integrals (antiderivatives) but not definite integrals and the FTC.  

The applied context here is a differential equation modeling the movement of variables in and out of a cell membrane.  It's a saturation model.
