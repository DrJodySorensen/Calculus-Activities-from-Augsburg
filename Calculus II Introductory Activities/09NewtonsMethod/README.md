## Newton's Method

Today's activity introduces Newton's Method for approximating roots of equations, connecting it with the idea of sequences from the previous couple of days.  

The applied context is finding the time a hot beverage reaches a drinkable temperature.  This activity used to start by introducing this as a differential equation and have students solve this as review, but that ending up taking our students too long.  

The example does one step exactly, then asks them to do another step or two visually.  It doesn't have them derive the Newton's Method formula, that is done in class.
