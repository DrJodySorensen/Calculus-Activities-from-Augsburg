## Integration by Substitution

Today is the first of two days on substitution, and only considers indefinite integrals.  

The activity is straightforward with no applied example.  It starts with a  few chain rule examples, and then walks students through an integration example, where they discover for themselves why substitution is needed.  

Class time is spent on the correct notation, including the importance of the dx and du.
