## Inverse Trigonometric Functions

Today's activity is atypical for the course.  It's quite long, and doesn't have an applied example.  It's really more of an outline of the day's material, to be completed interactively.  

We find that students need a major refresher on trig at this point in the course.  This activity puts together trig values, inverse trig functions, and their derivatives.  It then connects this to antiderivatives.
