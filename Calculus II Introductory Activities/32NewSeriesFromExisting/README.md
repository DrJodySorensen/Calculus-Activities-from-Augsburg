## New Series from Old

At the end of the course we take a day (or two) that we call New Series from Old.  Students learn that you can take a known Taylor Series for a function and alter it to create the series for a new, related function: differentiation, integration (carefully), substitution, multipying by a power of $x$, multiplying two functions, etc.  

The activity is not applied but has students walk though a few examples and discover what works.
