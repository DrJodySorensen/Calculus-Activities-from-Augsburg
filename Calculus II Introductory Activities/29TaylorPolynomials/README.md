Today's activity is much like one from late in our Calculus I course introducing Taylor polynomials as higher order approximations of a function at a point.  

The applied context is approximating shipping costs based on number of items shipped.  

Class time is spent deriving the general formula for Taylor polynomials and using it on a few examples.
