## Improper Integrals

Today's activity introduces improper integrals.  The applied example is about the rate of drainage when emptying a pool.  The students do several definite integrals, then consider what happens as the upper limit grows.  

Note that the activity starts with a few basic facts about the natural logarithm function as a refresher.  

Lecture time is used to discuss the formal use of limits in these integrals, and the various types of improper integrals.
