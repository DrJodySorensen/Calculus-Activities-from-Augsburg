## Numerical Integration

No applied example today.  This activity introduce standard numerical integration methods.  Building off of Left and Right hand approximations, we add the Trapezoidal and Midpoint methods, and end with deriving Simpson's as a weighted average.  This is motivated by looking at errors when $n=4$ done by the students.  Eventually we look at errors for larger values of $n$, calculated using a prepared Desmos file.
