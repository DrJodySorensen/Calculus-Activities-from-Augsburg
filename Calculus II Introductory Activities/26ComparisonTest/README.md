## Comparison Tests

The activity starts with students organizing what they know about geometric series and p-series, the basis of most comparisons.  

It then walks students through a couple of examples of the Comparison Test, and has them think through what inequalities are (and are not) helpful.  This is the main emphasis of the day.  The lecture does cover the Limit Comparison Test as well.
