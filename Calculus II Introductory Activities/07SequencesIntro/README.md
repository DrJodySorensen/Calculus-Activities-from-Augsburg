## Introduction to Sequences

One of our goals for Calculus II is to spread the idea of infinite series throughout the course to improve retention and understanding.  

We start this today, quite early in the class, by formally introducing sequences.  We talk about both explicit and recursive formulas for sequences, and compare and contrast those.  

The applied contexts are a decreasing cost example, and a fish population growth example.
