## Probability

Today we introduce probabilty as an application of integration, and specifically a common use of improper integrals.  

The applied examples involve the time it takes students to finish an exam, and the expected lifetime of a light bulb.  

In class we go over the theory of probability density functions, and introduce exponential and normal pdfs.
