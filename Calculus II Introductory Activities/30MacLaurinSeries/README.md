## MacLaurin Series

Today students practice with Taylor Series and learn the basic series for $\sin(x), \cos(x), e^x$ and $\ln(x)$.  

The Day 30 activity is very similar to the Day 31 activity.  I sometimes use the latter spread over two days, and perhaps add some additional examples.  The goal is to have students work through all the steps of creating a series, checking by graphing, finding interval of convergence, and using the series appropriately.
