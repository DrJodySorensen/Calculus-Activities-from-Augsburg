## The Ratio Test

Today we introduce the ratio test, using the idea of geometric series as motivation.  

Students work through an example and demonstrate that the integral test and comparison test are not helpful.  They then walk through the steps of the Ratio Test for that example.  

I always point out that the Ratio Test doesn't require doing an improper integral, or coming up with the correct series to compare with.  The only drawback is that it can be inconclusive.
