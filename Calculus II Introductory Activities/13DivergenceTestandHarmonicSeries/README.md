## The Divergence Test and the Harmonic Series

Today's activity introduces the harmonic series in the context of musical harmonic overtones.  

In the activity students compare the harmonic and alternating harmonic series numerically.  There are also additional examples that point to the ideas of the Divergence Test (nth term test), and the comparison tests.
