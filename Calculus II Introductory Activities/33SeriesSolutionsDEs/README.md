## Series Solutions to Differential Equations

We end our Calc II class by working on series solutions to differential equations.  This topic pulls together several big ideas from various parts of the course, including the always challenging "what does it mean to have a solution to a DE" concept.  

Our current book likes to do this with simple DEs like $y' = 3y$ to show that you come up with the correct, recognizable series.  I always point out that the real value of this technique is that you can get an approximate solution near a point of any desired accuracy.  

The activity walks them through an example, and they typically need help and discussion to complete the steps.
