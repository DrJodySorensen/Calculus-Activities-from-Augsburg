Day 2 Slope Fields and Euler's Method

Today's activity walks students through the idea of a slope field, and has them work through one step of Euler's Method.  
The applied example is known as Gompertz' Model for the growth of a tumor.  

Not much time is spent on creating slope fields, just on knowing how to use them.  
Class time is spent showing Euler's method, and how to organize it into a table.
