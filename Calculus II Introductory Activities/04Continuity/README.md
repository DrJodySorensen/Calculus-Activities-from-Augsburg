## Day 4 Continuity

To make room in Calc I for topics like partial derivatives, parametric equations, and quite a bit of integration, we moved some more theoretical topics like continuity and a slightly more formal treatment of limits to Calc II.  Day 4 introduces the definition of continuity, after working on a couple of examples.  

The examples are changing water temperature (continuous) and changing tutoring fees (step function).
