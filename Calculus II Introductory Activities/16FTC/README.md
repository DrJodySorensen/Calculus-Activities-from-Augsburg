## Fundamental Theorem of Calculus

Today's activity uses $d=rt$ to build up to the idea that the area under a velocity curve gives distance traveled, aka the FTC.  Students begin with discrete velocity data, find upper and lower estimates of distance traveled, and visualize this as area under a curve.  

This activity is written so that some of the big ideas are pieced together with a group discussion.
